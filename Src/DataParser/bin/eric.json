I almost hit a guy when he went around me as I was turning. I was making a right turn and he was making the same right and he came on my side as I was turning to make the right! Very close call!

    "Text": "I regularly see posts concerning No-Fault. Many people have a complete misconception of what No-Fault actually is. \nNo-Fault, aka PIP (personal injury protection) has been mandatory in the State of NY since 1974.\nNo-Fault was designed to pay promptly, regardless of who is at fault or whether there was any negligence, for ECONOMIC LOSSES (meaning medical/health expenses, lost earnings, and certain other reasonable and necessary expenses related to injuries sustained), up to $50,000 per person (\"basic No-Fault coverage\"), to the driver and all passengers injured in YOUR CAR as well as any pedestrians injured by YOUR CAR. \nIn no-fault states, auto insurance companies pay out claims filed by their respective policyholders to cover personal injuries after an accident. Who was at fault is irrelevant.\nFlorida, Kansas, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Utah are the states with no-fault car insurance laws. \nAll no-fault states include PIP as part of their minimum car insurance requirements. The only exception is Pennsylvania, where you only need medical payment coverage. No-fault states also place restrictions on your right to sue for injuries. You must meet the threshold of what qualifies as a ‚Äúserious injury‚Äù.",

She received fluids, was snap tested - negative for all, had blood and dental work done. Apparently the major problem was a few bad teeth that started accumulating hair and ended up with a big hair ball around them. She had a few teeth extracted. She‚Äôll be spending the weekend indoors with an amazing experienced foster and will be returned to her stomping grounds next week. If anyone wants to make a donation to Friends of Mount Vernon, they covered her bill - ",

Have these rebates even helped the bottom line for homeowners at all? Should I be talking with more local business that are not necessarily ConEd-certified?\n\nThanks!",

During the pandemic, I taught my youngest son and prepared him for Kindergarten. I previously took care of a child. His parents entrusted him to me when he was 6 months old until he was 23 months old. They bring their sweet boy to my house. Sadly, the family transferred to a different town.\n\nIf you are looking for someone to take care of your child, I am and will be available by September or earlier. \n\nIf you are willing to bring your child to my home, message me. Do not worry because my previous employer can attest that your child is safe with me and will be treated as part of our family. üôÇ\n\nMy location: White Plains, NY 10605",
